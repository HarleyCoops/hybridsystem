# Setup Guide

Complete setup takes about 10 minutes.

---

## Step 1: Install Claude Code

If you don't have Claude Code installed:

1. Visit [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
2. Follow installation instructions for macOS
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   claude --version
   ```

---

## Step 2: Create Craft Documents

Create three documents in Craft. You can name them whatever you like (configure names in Step 5), but the defaults are:

### The Watchtower (Daily Hub)

```markdown
# The Watchtower

## Today - [Date]

### Sprint Status
[Generated by morning briefing]

### Today's Mission
[Generated by morning briefing]

### Transfer to Card
[Items for your physical card]

### Field Reports
[Quick captures throughout the day]

---

## Archive
[Previous days get moved here]
```

### The Forge (Task Pool)

```markdown
# The Forge

## Deep Work Forging
[Complex, creative, demanding tasks - requires peak energy]

- [ ] Example deep work task

## Standard Forge Work
[Productive, routine tasks - normal energy]

- [ ] Example standard task

## Light Smithing
[Admin, organizing, easy wins - low energy okay]

- [ ] Example light task

## The Anvil Awaits
[Someday/maybe ideas - no energy requirement]

- [ ] Example future idea
```

### The Long Road (Journey Tracker)

```markdown
# The Long Road

## Current Journey

**Days Traveled:** 1
**Current Status:** Fresh start

## Traveler's Condition
[Energy and health observations]

## Waystones Passed
[Daily entries - completions, energy, reflections]

### [Date]
- Tasks completed: X
- Energy: [high/medium/low]
- Notes: [observations]

## Insights
[Patterns and learnings over time]
```

---

## Step 3: Configure Craft MCP

The Craft MCP allows Claude Code to read and write your documents directly.

### Install the MCP Server

1. Open Claude Code settings
2. Add the Craft MCP server following [Craft's MCP guide](https://www.craft.do/imagine/guide/mcp/claude_code)

### Connect Your Documents

After installing the MCP, you need to share your three documents:

1. Open each document in Craft
2. Click Share → Copy Link (or get the document ID)
3. In Claude Code, verify connection:
   ```
   claude mcp list
   ```
   You should see your Craft documents listed.

### Test the Connection

```bash
# In Claude Code
claude

# Then type:
Read my Watchtower document and tell me what's in it.
```

If it can read the document, you're connected.

---

## Step 4: Install Hybrid System

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krispuckett/hybridsystem.git
cd hybridsystem
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
1. Check for Claude Code
2. Detect Craft MCP (optional but recommended)
3. Ask about customization (or use defaults)
4. Install scripts to `/usr/local/bin/watchtower-scripts/`
5. Create the main `watchtower` command
6. Save your config to `~/.watchtower/config`

---

## Step 5: Customize (Optional)

Edit `~/.watchtower/config` to change:

```bash
# Your peak energy windows (24-hour format)
PEAK_WINDOW_1_START=9
PEAK_WINDOW_1_END=13

# When to warn about long sprints
SPRINT_WARNING_DAY=14
SPRINT_DANGER_DAY=21

# Document names (if you renamed them)
DOC_DAILY="The Watchtower"
DOC_TASKS="The Forge"
DOC_JOURNEY="The Long Road"

# Enable optional modules
HEALTH_MODULE_ENABLED=false
```

See [Customization Guide](CUSTOMIZATION.md) for all options.

---

## Step 6: Test It

```bash
# Show available commands
watchtower

# Run your first morning briefing
watchtower brief

# Check status
watchtower status

# Add a test task
watchtower add "Test task" normal
```

---

## Step 7: Get a Physical Card System

The system works best with physical index cards or a card-based system:

- [Analogue](https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog) — Premium card system
- Plain index cards — Works fine
- Any pocket notebook — Cut to card size

The constraint of limited space forces prioritization.

---

## Daily Workflow

Once set up, your daily workflow is:

### Morning (5 minutes)
1. Run `watchtower brief`
2. Check Craft for priorities
3. Write top 3-5 items on physical card
4. Work from the card all day

### Evening (5 minutes)
1. Photo your card
2. Run `watchtower card ~/Downloads/photo.jpg`
3. Answer the energy question
4. Done — tomorrow is prepped

---

## Troubleshooting

### "watchtower: command not found"

The command wasn't installed to your PATH. Try:
```bash
# Check if it exists
ls -la /usr/local/bin/watchtower

# If it's a directory (common issue), remove and reinstall
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/watchtower
cd hybridsystem
./install.sh
```

### "Craft MCP not detected"

The system works without Craft MCP, but you'll need to manually update documents. To fix:

1. Verify Claude Code has Craft MCP installed
2. Check `claude mcp list`
3. See [Craft's MCP documentation](https://www.craft.do/imagine/guide/mcp/claude_code)

### Scripts not executable

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/watchtower-scripts/*.sh
```

### Wrong timezone

Edit `~/.watchtower/config`:
```bash
TIMEZONE="America/New_York"  # Change to your timezone
```

And add to your shell config:
```bash
echo 'export TZ="America/New_York"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

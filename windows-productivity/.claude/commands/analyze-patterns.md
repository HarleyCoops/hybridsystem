# Deep Pattern Analysis

Perform a comprehensive accountability check and pattern analysis.

## Review Areas

1. **Avoidance Patterns**
   - Which tasks have been rolled forward 3+ times?
   - What's the common thread? (Type of work? Difficulty? Unclear scope?)
   - What might be the underlying resistance?

2. **Sprint Health**
   - Current consecutive work days
   - Comparison to warning/danger thresholds
   - Signs of pushing too hard or coasting?

3. **Energy Patterns**
   - When is the user most productive (morning/afternoon/evening)?
   - Correlation between energy and completion rate
   - Any concerning trends?

4. **Category Balance**
   - Distribution across Deep/Standard/Light/Someday
   - Is important work being deferred for easy wins?
   - Healthy mix or concerning imbalance?

5. **Completion Trends**
   - 7-day completion rate
   - Improving, declining, or stable?
   - Day-of-week patterns?

## Output Format

Provide:
- **Honest Assessment**: Use appropriate coaching voice
- **Specific Recommendations**: 2-3 actionable next steps
- **Recognition**: What's working well
- **Key Insight**: One observation the user might not see themselves

Be direct but compassionate. This is a supportive check-in, not a lecture.

# Morning Briefing

Generate a morning briefing for the Watchtower productivity system.

Analyze the current state and provide:
1. **Sprint Status**: Current day count and health assessment
2. **Pattern Alerts**: Any tasks rolled 3+ times (avoidance patterns)
3. **Energy Forecast**: Based on recent energy readings and time of day
4. **Today's Mission**: Suggested 3-5 priority items for the physical card
5. **Coaching Insight**: One observation based on detected patterns

Use the appropriate coaching voice based on what patterns are detected:
- If avoidance patterns: Channel Marcus Aurelius (discipline)
- If burnout signals: Channel Gandalf (wisdom)
- If scattered priorities: Channel Aragorn (leadership)

Format as a structured, scannable briefing the user can reference throughout the day.
